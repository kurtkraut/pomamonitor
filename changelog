             - Detects if a host is being handled by guide.opendns.com, what indicates it is offline. Important for OpenDNS.com users.
             - Now grep is a dependency for pomamonitor.
             - Now bind9-host (the 'host' command) is a dependency for pomamonitor.
             - fping wasn't outputing all errors he got. This as fixed by adding 2>&1 to the syntax.

changes:     - Using the the term 'checks' instead of 'tests' to the attemps to check if a host is online.
             - Now checks are done through all network cards, including wireless, not only the default route (fping -m).
             - More indented code (a twitter.com/turicas suggestion).
             - Now pomamonitor.conf requires the usage of quotes to values.
             - The pomamonitor.conf content is directly injected to pomamonitor.sh, without parsing. We'll all grown up men. (a twitter.com/turicas suggestion).
             - Now first check are done in $brief_delay, not in 5 seconds anymore. This should give enough time to a wireless connection to be up for the first check.
             - Instead of alerting user it is running, pomamonitor only does a notify-send after the first check, telling if a host is down or if they're all online.
             - The $counter variable, that stores the number of times that checks were already done in the current run is more widely outputed.
             - The $targets_qty variable, that stores the number of targets to monitor was created and is widely outputed.
